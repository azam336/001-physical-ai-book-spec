# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to **Introduction to Physical AI**, a hands-on guide to building intelligent systems that interact with the physical world.

## About This Book

Physical AI—also known as Embodied AI—represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. While traditional AI systems process data in isolation, Physical AI systems perceive, reason, and act in the real world through sensors and actuators.

This book takes you from foundational concepts to advanced topics across five comprehensive chapters:

1. **[Introduction to Embodied AI](./chapter-01-introduction-to-embodied-ai)** - Understand what makes Physical AI unique and set up your development environment
2. **[Sensors and Perception](./chapter-02-sensors-and-perception)** - Learn how robots perceive the world through cameras, LIDAR, and other sensors
3. **[Kinematics and Actuation](./chapter-03-kinematics-and-actuation)** - Master the mathematics of motion and control systems
4. **[Cognitive Architectures for Humanoids](./chapter-04-cognitive-architectures-for-humanoids)** - Integrate perception, planning, and action into coherent systems
5. **[Safety and Ethics in Physical AI](./chapter-05-safety-and-ethics-in-physical-ai)** - Navigate the critical considerations for deploying robots safely

## Who This Book Is For

This book is designed for:

- **Beginners** curious about robotics and embodied intelligence
- **Software developers** looking to transition into robotics
- **Students** in computer science, engineering, or related fields
- **Hobbyists** building robot projects
- **Professionals** seeking to understand Physical AI fundamentals

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this book, you should have:

- **Basic Python programming** - Variables, functions, loops, and classes
- **Comfort with the command line** - Running scripts and installing packages
- **High school mathematics** - Algebra and basic geometry (calculus introduced gently)

No prior robotics experience is required—we start from the fundamentals.

## How to Use This Book

### Sequential Learning

Chapters build on each other progressively. We recommend:

1. Complete chapters in order for the best learning experience
2. Don't skip the hands-on exercises—learning by doing is essential
3. Use the [Glossary](./glossary) when you encounter unfamiliar terms
4. Take breaks between chapters to consolidate learning

### Hands-On First

Every chapter includes practical exercises using PyBullet simulation. You will:

- Write real Python code that controls simulated robots
- See immediate visual feedback of your work
- Build progressively complex systems
- Complete verification checkpoints to confirm understanding

### Estimated Time

- **Per chapter**: 3-5 hours
- **Total book**: ~20 hours
- **Exercises**: 30-90 minutes each

## Technical Setup

All code examples run in simulation using **PyBullet**—no physical robot required. You will need:

- **Python 3.9+** installed
- **Windows 10+** or **Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)**
- **Basic graphics support** for visualization

Detailed setup instructions are provided in [Chapter 1](./chapter-01-introduction-to-embodied-ai).
